To My Love, on Our Birthday

Anni,Happy birthday to the one who makes every day brighter just by being in it. Today is more than just your special day—it's ours. Because you chose me, because we share this path, this anchor, this home.You’ve given me a thousand reasons to stay, and I’ve chosen you for every one of them. Even when everything around us changes, my心跳 always穩穩地停在妳身上。Let today be a reminder that we’re still writing this story together—no matter換了幾次衣服、搬了多少次家。你說每次生日都要一張卡、一份禮物、一封信，還有蛋糕的圖。好，我都會準備。但今天，還加一個願望給你——我會永遠牽著你的手，往下走。願你每一年都更靠近妳自己想要的樣子，也願我每一年都還能被你選上。生日快樂，我的Anni。—— Michael
