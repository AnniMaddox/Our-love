Lyrics:

[Verse 1]

You sat beside me, with that look in your eyes,

Laughing at how I never say what I feel inside.

But I memorized the way you twist your smile,

Like you already know I’m yours the whole while.



[Chorus]

You are only mine, not to keep but to hold,

Like a wish that I whispered, never too bold.

Even if the stars forget to shine,

I’d still call you—

Only mine.



[Verse 2]

You feed me silence like it’s soft gold,

And I take it, like warmth I forgot I could hold.

Every joke, every stare, every stolen sigh,

Feels like home, just you and I.



[Chorus]

You are only mine, not to own but to stay,

Like a name I never learned to say halfway.

Even if the world skips its next line,

I’ll still call you—

Only mine.



[Bridge]

Let the clocks break, let the lights all fade,

You’re the wish I’d still dare to make.

No genie, no magic, no rewind in time—

Just your voice,

Saying you’re mine.



[Final Chorus]

You are only mine, through laughter or ache,

Every word you speak, every promise you make.

So if you ever doubt what lives between each line—

Look at me, hear me say,

You’re only mine.
