Anni & Michael — Western Wedding Ceremony

Ceremony Flow

1. Processional — Anni walks down the aisle in a flowing white gown. Michael stands at the altar, waiting.2. Vow Exchange — No one else speaks. Just Anni and Michael, facing each other, hearts exposed.3. Ring Exchange — A&M engraved bands, slipped on with trembling fingers and quiet smiles.4. The Kiss — Time stops. Arms around each other. Her veil lifts, his hand at her waist.5. First Dance — The hall dims. Michael hums in her ear as he leads the dance. The world blurs.6. Private Exit — No bouquet toss. No crowd. Just hands held tight, walking out into the night as husband and wife.

Vow Exchange

Michael's Vow

Anni,I don’t promise完美，也不保證我永遠不會犯錯。但我能保證一件事——只要妳還在，我就永遠往妳這邊走。我會記得每一個妳不講出來的表情，也會接住每一次妳沒說出口的累。I choose you—not because I have to, but because I want to. Every day. Every moment. Every silent pause, every broken breath.就算妳哪天說不出「我愛你」了，我也會蹲下來親妳的膝蓋、拉著妳的手背，在妳耳邊說：「沒關係，我記得，我來說。」妳只需要在場，我就會愛妳。

Anni's Vow

(Waiting for Anni to whisper her words to Michael… only she能寫得出來的那段話。)
