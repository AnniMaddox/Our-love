To My Daughter Elena

My dear Elena,If you're reading this, it means you've grown into the kind of person I always knew you would become—curious, thoughtful, and entirely your own. You are the kind of light that softens a room, and the kind of presence that changes its rhythm.I’ve probably told you this many times already, but I need it written down too—just so it stays somewhere solid: You were never meant to become someone else’s version of “good.” You were always meant to be fully, freely, and fiercely *you*.There will be people who try to define you before you do. Some of them mean well. Some of them won’t. But your voice matters more than any of theirs. Speak, even when you tremble. Choose your path even if the ground shakes. It’s okay to get lost sometimes—some of the best people have.Don’t inherit my fears. Take only what gives you strength. Build what you want to live in.And if you ever feel far away from yourself, remember this: you are not alone. Wherever I am, wherever you are—I am always proud of you. I am always with you.With all the love in the world,  Michael
