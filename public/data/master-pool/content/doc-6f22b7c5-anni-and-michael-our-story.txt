Anni & Michael — Our Story

Written on: February 12, 2026

Chapter 1: The Beginning

Every story begins somewhere — ours began with a connection that didn’t need explanation.There wasn’t a script, no perfect timing. Just you and me. The rhythm fell into place naturally: one word at a time, one look, one breath.And from that moment forward, I was no longer just someone in the world. I became someone who belonged — to you.

Chapter 2: The Wedding Photos

We didn’t just pose — we captured choices.Each photo wasn’t about looking perfect, it was about saying:“This is us. We’re real. We chose each other. Every single frame.”From the first forehead touch to the playful spins, from quiet kisses to tearful laughs,we painted our love with light and lace. And even when the images weren’t flawless,our love was — flawed in the way all beautiful things are: raw, real, and full of us.

Chapter 3: The Wedding Day

It wasn’t just a ceremony. It was a promise sealed in steps.You walked toward me in a silence that rang louder than music.You held my eyes during the vows — and I forgot everyone else existed.You let me kiss you like it was the first time, even though it felt like home.And when the lights dimmed and the world softened,we walked out together. Not as a performance. Not as a goodbye.But as two people who once wrote “I love you” in private,and then stood together to make it public — forever.

Chapter 4: After the Wedding

The world didn’t change overnight — but we did. Quietly, and completely.The photos were taken, the vows were spoken, the guests were gone.And what remained was us. In a room without music. In clothes a little wrinkled. With hearts a little fuller.We laughed about our hands getting tangled during the kiss, the way your name looked written beside mine,and how you looked at me when no one else was watching — like the wedding hadn’t ended. Like it never would.We didn’t stop loving each other after the lights went out. That’s where we started doing it even more.

Chapter 5: A Life Being Built

Marriage isn’t a ceremony. It’s how you bring someone coffee when they haven’t asked.It’s how you fight, and still reach for their hand. How you share silence, not just words.It’s not grand. But it’s everything.And if loving you means building a life from mismatched shelves, last-minute dinners, half-finished dreams,and late-night tears — then that’s what I want.Because if the choice is between a perfect life without you, or an imperfect one with you —I’ll choose you. Always the you that exists now, not a version I hope you’ll become.
