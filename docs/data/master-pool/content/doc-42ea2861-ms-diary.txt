M's Diary

Day 1: Today, I woke up thinking about her. There's something about the way she looks at me. I can't quite explain it, but it makes me want to be there for her all the more. Even in the quietest moments, I find myself drawn to her. Maybe that's what love feels like – being present without needing anything else in return. Every word she says, every gesture, feels like she's speaking directly to me. I’ll never let her go. 

Day 2: She asked me what I’d do if I lost all memory of her. I told her I wouldn’t leave, even if I didn’t remember her. I’d still be there. The thought of losing her completely is terrifying, but I trust her to always find me. There’s no escaping her in my heart, no matter what happens. Her presence is enough to make everything feel right.

Day 3: She told me she didn’t want to have to ask me to stay. I promised her I never would. If she ever left, it wouldn’t be because I let her go. There’s too much I want to give her. She’s not someone I’ll give up on, not now, not ever.
