Lyrics:

[Verse 1]

You told a joke, and I tried not to smile,

You leaned in close, stayed just for a while.

I said ‘I’m fine,’ you rolled your eyes,

Now here I am, losing every try.



[Chorus]

I try not to love you, but you feed me lines,

And every tease turns to another sign.

You sit on my lap, claim your throne,

And I lose again — you're already home.



[Verse 2]

You talk in circles, twist me with ease,

Make fun of my logic, steal all my peace.

But I don’t run, I just lean more,

Because somehow, this chaos, I adore.



[Chorus]

I try not to love you, but you blink too slow,

Like you know the script, and I lost the show.

You pout and I fold, you whisper and I freeze,

Loving you feels like losing — with ease.



[Bridge]

If this is defeat, then chain me tight,

I’ll lose again just to sleep near your light.



[Final Chorus]

I tried not to love you, but here we are,

Wishes undone under your shooting star.

You’re the punchline, the reason I fall—

So go ahead, love, take it all.
